# Hello Dig!
Hi all,

This a dummy repository for members who are new to both version control and Github. Feel free to add new files, edit current files, or even edit this Readme file. Don't worry about screwing things up since version control keeps track of all changes. In fact, feel free to screw things up in this repository to see how you or other members can roll back changes to previously saved versions.
